## 🏃‍♂️ How to Run

- **PostgreSQL** — a running PostgreSQL instance
- **Google Cloud Console** — create an OAuth 2.0 Client ID
- **Gemini API Key** — obtain from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/)

### 2. Clone & Install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Piyk/meritspace.git
cd meritspace

# Install all dependencies (root + client + server)
npm run install-all
```

### 3. Configuration
Create your environment file at `server/.env` (use `server/.env.sample` as a reference):
```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/exam_flow"
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id.apps.googleusercontent.com
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_key
ADMIN_EMAIL=your_email@domain.com
ALLOWED_DOMAINS=domain.com,gmail.com
PORT=your_port
FRONTEND_URL=your_frontend_url
GEMINI_MODEL=your_gemini_model
```
> Also update the Google Client ID in `client/src/App.tsx` if required.

### 4. Database Setup
Initialize the database schema with Prisma:
```bash
cd server
npx prisma db push

# Optional: Run the data migration helper for initial setup
node migrate_db.js
```

### 5. Run the App
Open two terminals from the project root:
```bash
# Terminal 1 — Backend server
npm run server

# Terminal 2 — Frontend dev server
npm run client
```
The client will be available at `http://localhost:5173` and the server at `http://localhost:3000` by default.

## 🎨 Theming System
MeritSpace features a dynamic, persistent theming system. Users can switch between **Light**, **Dark**, and **Jet Black** modes, and Admins can configure a global color preset for all users. Students can also adjust their theme live during an exam via the floating Appearance Panel.

**Available Color Presets:**
- 🌊 Ocean Blue
- 🌲 Forest Green
- 🟣 Royal Purple
- 🌹 Rose Gold
- 🌑 Slate
- 🍊 Classic Orange

---

## 🛡️ Security Notes
- The **first user** to authenticate is automatically promoted to **ADMIN**.
- All sessions are secured via **JWT tokens** verified against Google OAuth.
- **CORS** and **domain allow-listing** protect the API for organizational deployments.
- Exam state and answers are persisted server-side to prevent client-side tampering.
